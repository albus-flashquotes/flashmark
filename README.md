# Arcify

Arc browser was shut down and is no longer supported. Arcify brings my favorite Arc features to Chrome as an extension — giving you Arc-like experiences without leaving Chrome.

## Features

### 🎯 Command Palette
Quickly search and open tabs, bookmarks, and actions with a keyboard-first interface.

- **Cmd+K** (Mac) / **Ctrl+K** (Windows) to open
- Search across open tabs, bookmarks, and built-in actions
- Smart prioritization: tabs → bookmarks → actions
- Press Enter to open, Tab for action settings

### ⚡ Quick Switcher
Switch between recent tabs instantly, just like Cmd+Tab for apps.

- **Ctrl+Q** to activate
- Tabs ordered by most recently used (MRU)
- Keep holding Ctrl and press Q to cycle
- Release Ctrl to switch

### 🛠️ Built-in Actions
- **Cleanup** — Close tabs that aren't bookmarked (keep what matters)
- **Reset** — Close all tabs and start fresh with your home page
- **Settings** — Configure search engine, reset URL, and more
- **Reload Extension** — Quick reload for development

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl+K` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quick switch tabs |
| `↑↓` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | Select / Open |
| `Tab` | Open action settings |
| `Esc` | Close palette |

## Why "Arcify"?

Arc browser had some genuinely great UX ideas. When it was discontinued, I wanted to keep using those patterns. Arcify is my way of bringing Arc's best features to Chrome — starting with the command palette and quick switcher.
